<h3> Tourism in Jordan  </h3>
 <strong>There are  a lot of places you can enjoy when you visited in jordan </strong>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<b> 1)Witness Petra by Night</b>
</br>
Lit only by candles and a shower of stars overhead, Petra passageway to the Treasury hides its main attraction beneath a reverential darkness. The curves and ripples of raspberry-rust rock that mesmerize by day disappear at night, lost in the inky silence. Petra by night wasnt beautiful and it didnt move me. Amid the half-light in Jordan, it overwhelmed me. 
</br>
</br>

<b>2) Take flight over Wadi Rum</b>
</br>
    From the ground, the desert wilderness of Wadi Rum mesmerises. From the skies above looking down, it provides the kind of views that make you feel lucky to be alive.  </b>
</br>
</br>
<b> 3) Taste Knafeh in Amman</b>
</br>
 Knafeh, like the stone and sand of the city of Amman itself, has a deliciously rich history (and taste). Delirious with calories, this butter-soaked streetside snack presses cheese between syrup-soaked angel hair and then sprinkles it with rosewater and pistachios. Its also a great example of Jordanian food you can learn to make yourself.
</br>
</br>
<b>4) Float about in the Dead Sea</b>
</br>
Lets face it, the Dead Sea has a depressing name. However, it does make adults act like children as they flip about like penguins on an oil-slicked underwater escalator and slather themselves in black mud to create a slick human wetsuit. And who wants to miss that?
</br>
</br>
<b>5) Go canyoning in Wadi Mujib</b>
</br>
If wading through the Dead Sea seems too tranquil, a short trip to Wadi Mujib will soon get your pulse racing again with a spot of canyoning. Dont be fooled into thinking canyoning is only for those insanely fit folk; its an inclusive sport which is demonstrated beautifully . Get a taste for canyoning in Wadi Mujib of course   you will like it
</br>
</br>
<b>6) Write your name into history</b> 
</br>
At Mount Nebo, theres an incredible mosaic in production. It depicts The Kings Way, a route that runs from Aqaba and the Red Sea north to Bosra Sham. When complete, it will run for more than 30 metres involving more than 3.5 million pieces and expects to earn the record of being the largest mosaic in the world (if you look closely, youll find a piece with my name on it. And one there from the Queen). Were not special, though. The city of Madaba invites every guest to take part in the project, no matter your birthplace or background.
<br>
<br>
<b>7) See the stars with the Bedouin</b>
</br>
Free from light and sound pollution, the Feynan Eco-Lodges green credentials stretch beyond simply not washing your towels every day and printing out lots of leaflets to tell you about it instead. Get back to basics under the stars of the Jordanian desert with an engaging storyteller, roaring fire and arabic coffee for company.
